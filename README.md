# Car-diagnostic-report-analysis-Chinese-Version-
This is my tensorflow2.0 implementation of the NLG  models applied to [Baidu competition](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/3): summarizing the car diagnostic reports for a mobile APP. The dataset contains a 110,000 car-related questions or problems provided by app users, following by multi-round dialogues between technicians and app users. The main task is to filter the most import information based on conversations in order to build think tank for this mobile APP company.
